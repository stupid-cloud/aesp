Overview
--------

PyCSP (Python Crystal Structure Predictor) is a software for crystal structure prediction based on 
first-principles and deep learning techniques. It aims to provide a flexible and powerful tool for 
predicting the crystal structures of materials, supporting researchers and engineers in the field of 
materials science and engineering.

Features
--------

1. **Crystal Structure Prediction:**
   PyCSP can predict the crystal structures of various materials, including metals, semiconductors, 
   ceramics, etc. Whether it's simple elemental structures or complex compounds, PyCSP provides 
   reliable predictions.

2. **First-Principles Calculations:**
   PyCSP supports first-principles calculations to predict material properties such as electronic 
   structures, band structures, lattice parameters, etc. This method provides accurate results, 
   especially suitable for small molecules and pure materials.

3. **Deep Learning Models:**
   PyCSP integrates deep learning models trained on large amounts of known crystal structure data to 
   improve the accuracy and speed of predicting crystal structures of new materials. This approach is 
   particularly effective in handling complex organic and inorganic crystal structures.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   PyCSP offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily perform crystal structure prediction 
   and analysis. With simple commands or a graphical interface, users can quickly obtain the desired results 
   and perform further analysis and visualization.

5. **Scalability:**
   PyCSP's architecture is designed with strong scalability. Users can add new first-principles calculation 
   methods or deep learning models as needed to accommodate the prediction requirements of different types 
   of materials.
